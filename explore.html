            <p>The name Burren is derived from an Irish word Boireann meaning "a rocky place"
                The stone that makes up the Burren was laid down during the Carboniforous period and the rock was most likely exposed by over farming by early settlers 
                combined with a period of intense rainfall. The Burren has a host of activities to offer the visitor with many well marked walking trails, 
                educational tours, historical sites such as Pol na Bron and attractions such as Ailwee caves.<br>
