# West Clare Motorhome Park
The last number of years, possibly aided by the COVID pandemic and associated travel constraints, have seen an explosion in Motorhome ownership in Ireland. There have been three fundemantal responses to this growth, the first is a rise in the number of motorhome parks in Ireland or the expansion of traditional camp sites to cater for motorhomes. Secondly, slowly but surely some councils are seeing the benefit of creating Aires ( one night pull in points) in towns and villages to facilitate safe parking / waste diposal etc. Finally, some councils when faced with the sudden influx of motorhomes are reacting negatively and putting bars on parking facilities to restrict access to cars.

When a potential customer accesses a motorhome website, especially for a place they have not been before, they have a number of questions in mind that they need answered quickly and clearly. These questions include where exactly is the motohome park?, what facilities are available?, what are the site rules ? , how far is the site from a town etc, how much does it cost per night?  This website answers all those questions clearly on the landing page. The site then also facilitates further exploration of the locality and finally a booking request can be made.

### Site location map

The site location map shows the visitor where the park is located and enables the user to plan on how to get there. This is an image right now rather than an active connection into Google maps. Future iteration of the page could have an active connection into Google maps to enable searching around the locality.
