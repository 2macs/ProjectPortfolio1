# West Clare Motorhome Park
The last number of years, possibly aided by the COVID pandemic and associated travel constraints, have seen an explosion in Motorhome ownership in Ireland. There have been three fundemantal responses to this growth, the first is a rise in the number of motorhome parks in Ireland or the expansion of traditional camp sites to cater for motorhomes. Secondly, slowly but surely some councils are seeing the benefit of creating Aires ( one night pull in points) in towns and villages to facilitate safe parking / waste diposal etc. Finally, some councils when faced with the sudden influx of motorhomes are reacting negatively and putting bars on parking facilities to restrict access to cars.

When a potential customer accesses a motorhome website, especially for a place they have not been before, they have a number of questions in mind that they need answered quickly and clearly. These questions include where exactly is the motohome park?, what facilities are available?, what are the site rules ? , how far is the site from a town etc, how much does it cost per night?  This website answers all those questions clearly on the landing page. The site then also facilitates further exploration of the locality and finally a booking request can be made.

## Site Features
The following features are common to each of the website pages;

The page Banner shows the Motorhome banner and has three links - Home, Explore Locally and Booking Enquiry. Each page will be explained in more detail however these links enable the visitor to navigate seamlessly between the website pages.

The footer of the website is split into 3 sections. On the bottom left are links to popular social media websites, these website open in a separate tab. The centre section has a "Call to Action" to prompt a follow up from a potential customer. The right hand bottom section gives the customer another opportunity to make a booking enquiry.

### Landing Page Image

The landing page image shows a view of the ocean from the park, it is indicative of the type of scenery to be experienced when staying at the motorhome park. 

### Site Amenities section

This section details the facilities available at the park, some background on the park and a list of park rules / guidelines. A potential visitor can see quite quickly if the site fulfils some or all of their travel needs. At the top of this section there are links to enable the visitor to navigate to and from different sections of this page.

### Site location map

The site location map shows the visitor where the park is located and enables the user to plan on how to get there. This is an image right now rather than an active connection into Google maps. Future iteration of the page could have an active connection into Google maps to enable searching around the locality.

### Places to Explore section

This section gives a potential visitor an idea of some of the key attractions located near to the park. Right now there are 3 attractions listed, this could be expanded greatly in future iterations of the website.


### The cliffs of Moher
The cliffs of Moher are one of Irelands most popular tourist attractions and are on most visitors bucket lists whether an international or domestic visitor to the area. There is a link included which enables the curiouys visitor to dig deeper and find out more.

### Surfing in Lahinch

### The Burren
The Burren is another reason many people come to Clare. The area attracts hikers, botanists, tourists, fishermen etc. Again being close the Burren is an advantage for the Motorhome park. The website contains a link to enable a curious visitor to find out more about the Burren, this link opens in a new tab as do the others on this page.

### The Booking Form
This page has two features. The first feature is a booking enquiry form, the visitor can fill in some basic details, planned arrival and departure dates and submit. The site owner will then respond with options. A future enhancement would be to allow the visitor to select a pitch, book and pay online in advance of arrival. Note each field in the booking form is a required field and cannot be submitted unless fully completed.

This page also has an image of a Sunlight T64 motorhome sitting in one of our more private pitches. Note this image is hidden for mobile screens.
